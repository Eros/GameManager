# Contributing

Any contributions are welcome for this project. However there is some guide lines that must be followed before contributing your code

# Guidelines

1) All code must be your own or have credit from the original developer. If it's code from someone else make sure that you have been given permission to use it
2) All code will be reviewed before being added into the repo for obvious reasons
3) I will not add everything that is requested.
4) Nothing stupid
5) Don't cry if your content is not added, if you really wanna know why it wasn't added message me.
6) Open a pull request when you wish to add your own code in.
7) Create an issue for any bugs. See the issues template in this repo.
